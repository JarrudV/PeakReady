Yep. If a workout just says “Strength + core” with no recipe, it’s basically a fortune cookie.

Here’s the fix: every session becomes clickable and opens a Workout Detail view with a clear “do this” plan.

What to add (simple + effective)

1) Add these fields to each session

You already have description, but we need structured detail:
	•	goal (1 line)
	•	warmup (bullets)
	•	mainSet (bullets)
	•	cooldown (bullets)
	•	equipment (bullets)
	•	timeCap (minutes)
	•	notes (optional)

If you don’t want to change your data model, you can store this as one string field:
detailsMarkdown

That’s the fastest.

How to implement in the app (fast)

UI

On Training Plan list:
	•	Make each row tappable
	•	Open a modal or route: /session/:id

Data

Add a lookup map:
workoutLibrary[type] or workoutLibrary[sessionKey]

Example:
	•	Strength sessions use Strength A or B alternating
	•	Rides use templates based on description keywords

⸻

If you want the quickest possible version

Tell Gemini to:
	1.	Add a details button on each session row
	2.	Open a modal showing detailsMarkdown
	3.	Preseed detailsMarkdown for all sessions using templates above

If you want, paste one week of your current session JSON (or a screenshot of week 1) and I’ll convert the entire 12 week plan into clean “click to view” workout cards with proper detail.
